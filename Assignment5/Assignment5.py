    # DDGSpring216 Assignment 5
    # 
    # In this programming assignment you will implement Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of covectors.
    #
    # The relevant mathematics and algorithm are described in section 8.1 of the course notes.
    # You will also need to implement the core operators in discrete exterior calculus, described mainly in 
    # section 3.6 of the course notes.
    #
    # This code can be run with python Assignment5.py MODE /path/to/you/mesh.obj. MODE should be
    # either 'simple' or 'fancy', corresponding to the complexity of the input field omega that is given.
    # It might be easier to debug your algorithm on the simple field first. The assignment code will read in your input 
    # mesh, generate a field 'omega' as input, run your algorithm, then display the results.
    # The results can be viewed as streamlines on the surface that flow with the covector field (toggle with 'p'),
    # or, as actual arrows on the faces (toggle with 'l'). The keys '1'-'4' will switch between the input, exact,
    # coexact, and harmonic fields (respectively).
    # 
    # A few hints:
    #   - Try performing some basic checks on your operators if things don't seem right. For instance, applying the 
    #     exterior derivative twice to anything should always yield zero.
    #   - The streamline visualization is easy to look at, but can be deceiving at times. For instance, streamlines
    #     are not very meaningful where the actual covectors are near 0. Try looking at the actual arrows in that case
    #     ('l').
    #   - Many inputs will not have any harmonic components, especially genus 0 inputs. Don't stress if the harmonic 
    #     component of your output is exactly or nearly zero.
    
    
    # Implement the body of each of these functions...

        decomposition algorithm (as described on page 107-108 of the course notes)

              has handy helper functions pre-defined for each of these: mesh.enumerateEdges() etc.

              hodge0, hodge1, hodge2, d0, and d1. You should also compute their inverses and
              transposes, as appropriate.

            - Build a vector which represents the input covector (from the edge.omega values)

            - Perform a linear solve for the exact component, as described in the algorithm
            
            - Perform a linear solve for the coexact component, as described in the algorithm

            - Compute the harmonic component as the part which is neither exact nor coexact

            - Store your resulting exact, coexact, and harmonic components on the mesh edges
